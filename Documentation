⚙️ Technical Notes for Developers
CORS Enabled: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is active. You can fetch data directly from localhost:3000 (React/Vue/Next.js).

Money Units: All budget inputs are in Millions. Sending 50 represents €50,000,000.

The "Undervalued Index":

This is a machine learning prediction (Random Forest).

Logic: It compares a player's Performance Value vs. their Actual Price.

UI Tip: Highlight players with an Index > 80 in Purple or Gold to show "Good Deal."

PCA Integration: The Clone Engine uses Principal Component Analysis to reduce noise. Matches are based on Playstyle, not just raw stat totals.
